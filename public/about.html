  My aerospace career was shortlived with limited avionics jobs. However, my skills and determination landed me computer systems maintenace jobs where I honed my skills in complex systems analysis, project management and team collaboration. I've also had the priviledge of working in a financial institution where my skills aided the organisation's computer systems and networks. This experiences have ingrained in me a commitment to excellece and a knack for finding solutions to intricate challenges.

  My web development journey started as a personal interest and has qickly evolved into a new professional path. I've immersed myself in learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm hoping to be able to to craft intuitive, user-friendly websites that marry aesthetics with functionality. I'm excited to bring my engineering mindset and dedication to quality to the world of web development, where creativity meets precision.
